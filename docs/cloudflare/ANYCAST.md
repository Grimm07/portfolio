# What is Anycast?

Anycast is a network addressing and routing method in which incoming requests can be routed to a variety of different locations / nodes.
In the context of a CDN, Anycast typically routes incoming traffic to the nearest data center with the capacity to process the request efficiently.
Selective routing allows an anycast network to be resilient in the face of high traffic volume, network congestion, and DDoS attacks.
