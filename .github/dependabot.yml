# Dependabot Configuration
#
# Dependabot is GitHub's automated dependency update tool that helps keep your
# project dependencies secure and up-to-date. It automatically:
# - Monitors your dependency files (package.json, Gemfile, etc.)
# - Checks for security vulnerabilities in your dependencies
# - Creates pull requests to update outdated packages
# - Helps maintain a secure and modern dependency stack
#
# Why Dependabot is important:
# - Security: Automatically patches known vulnerabilities in dependencies
# - Maintenance: Keeps dependencies current with latest features and bug fixes
# - Compliance: Helps meet security best practices and compliance requirements
# - Efficiency: Reduces manual dependency management overhead
#
# This configuration sets up automated dependency updates for:
# - npm packages (root and worker directories)
# - Terraform providers
# - GitHub Actions workflows
